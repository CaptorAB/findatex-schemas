  04030_Intended_Target_Market_Retail_Investor_Portfolio: "Typical investors in
    the Fund will be investors who are looking to maximise current yield through
    a combination of both income and capital growth and are looking for a
    diversified exposure to global fixed income markets and are willing to
    accept the risks and volatility associated with investing in such markets,
    including emerging markets and non investment grade securities, and who have
    an investment horizon over the medium to long term."
  04040_Investment_Objective_Portfolio:
    'Objectives The fund aims to maximise the
    total return on your investment through providing efficient access to broad
    global credit market exposure by investing primarily in a diversified
    portfolio of fixed income securities and instruments of varying maturities,
    using prudent investment management principles. Investment Policy The fund
    is an actively managed portfolio which seeks to achieve its investment
    objective by investing primarily in a diversified pool of corporate and
    emerging market fixed income securities and instruments (which are similar
    to loans that pay a fixed or variable rate of interest) issued by companies
    or governments from around the world. The fund’s average portfolio duration
    will normally be within positive or negative two years of that of the fund’s
    benchmark (an equally weighted blend of the Bloomberg Global Aggregate
    Credit ex-Emerging Markets, the ICE BofAML BB-B Rated Developed Markets High
    Yield Constrained and the JPMorgan EMBI Global, indices (all USD hedged))
    (together the “Benchmark”). Duration measures the sensitivity of the assets
    to interest rate risk. The longer the duration the higher the sensitivity to
    changes in interest rates. The fund is considered to be actively managed in
    reference to the Benchmark by virtue of the fact that the Benchmark is used
    for duration measurement, calculating the global exposure of the fund using
    the relative VaR methodology and for performance comparison purposes.
    Certain of the fund’s securities may be components of and may have similar
    weightings to the Benchmark. However, the Benchmark is not used to define
    the portfolio composition of the fund or as a performance target and the
    fund may be wholly invested in securities which are not constituents of the
    Benchmark. The securities will be both “investment grade” and
    “non-investment grade". Non-investment grade securities are considered to
    be more risky, but typically produce a higher level of income. The fund may
    invest substantially in emerging markets, which in investment terms are
    those economies that are still developing. The fund may invest in derivative
    instruments (such as futures, options and swaps) rather than directly in the
    underlying securities themselves. The derivatives return is linked to
    movements in the underlying assets. The assets held by the fund will mainly
    be in US Dollars but may be denominated in a wide variety of currencies.
    Non-USD denominated currency exposure is limited to 20% of total assets. The
    investment advisor may use foreign exchange and related derivative
    instruments to hedge or implement currency positions.'

  04040_Investment_Objective_Portfolio:
    "Objectives The fund aims to maximise the
    total return on your investment by taking exposure to a wide range of asset
    classes and through the dynamic application of the investment advisor's
    macro and relative value views across liquid markets, using prudent
    investment management principles. Investment Policy The fund aims to achieve
    this objective by taking exposure to a wide range of assets from around the
    world. The fund has a flexible approach to asset allocation which is driven
    by the investment advisor’s consideration of various quantitative and
    qualitative data relating to global economies, industrial sectors and asset
    classes. The fund will invest in company shares, fixed income securities
    (which are similar to loans that pay a fixed or variable rate of interest)
    issued by companies or governments and cash. The fund will typically invest
    up to 60% of its net assets in company shares or similar securities. Fixed
    income securities may be both “investment grade” and “non-investment grade”.
    Non-investment grade securities are considered to be more risky, but
    typically produce a higher level of income. The fund may invest
    substantially in emerging markets, which in investment terms are those
    economies that are not as developed. The fund may invest up to 15% of its
    total assets in commodity related instruments. The fund may gain exposure to
    property through property related instruments, including listed company
    shares, real estate investment trusts (REITs) or derivatives based on
    property related indices. The fund intends to measure its performance
    against the ICE BofA ESTR Overnight Rate Index (the “Index”). The fund is
    considered to be actively managed in reference to the Index by virtue of the
    fact that it uses the Index for performance comparison purposes. However the
    Index is not used to define the portfolio composition of the fund or as a
    performance target. The fund will promote environmental characteristics
    through active engagement with companies and issuers and exclusion
    screening. The fund may use derivatives instruments (such as futures,
    options and swaps) for hedging and/or as part of its investment strategy.
    The derivatives return is linked to movement in the underlying assets. The
    assets held by the fund may be denominated in a wide variety of currencies.
    The investment advisor may use foreign exchange and related derivative
    instruments to hedge or implement currency positions."

    classes and through the dynamic application of the investment advisor's
    macro and relative value views across liquid markets, using prudent
    investment management principles. Investment Policy The fund aims to achieve
    this objective by taking exposure to a wide range of assets from around the
    world. The fund has a flexible approach to asset allocation which is driven
    by the investment advisor’s consideration of various quantitative and
    qualitative data relating to global economies, industrial sectors and asset
    classes. The fund will invest in company shares, fixed income securities
    (which are similar to loans that pay a fixed or variable rate of interest)
    issued by companies or governments and cash. The fund will typically invest
    up to 60% of its net assets in company shares or similar securities. Fixed
    income securities may be both “investment grade” and “non-investment grade”.
    Non-investment grade securities are considered to be more risky, but
    typically produce a higher level of income. The fund may invest
    substantially in emerging markets, which in investment terms are those
    economies that are not as developed. The fund may invest up to 15% of its
    total assets in commodity related instruments. The fund may gain exposure to
    property through property related instruments, including listed company
    shares, real estate investment trusts (REITs) or derivatives based on
    property related indices. The fund intends to measure its performance
    against the ICE BofA ESTR Overnight Rate Index (the “Index”). The fund is
    considered to be actively managed in reference to the Index by virtue of the
    fact that it uses the Index for performance comparison purposes. However the
    Index is not used to define the portfolio composition of the fund or as a
    performance target. The fund will promote environmental characteristics
    through active engagement with companies and issuers and exclusion
    screening. The fund may use derivatives instruments (such as futures,
    options and swaps) for hedging and/or as part of its investment strategy.
    The derivatives return is linked to movement in the underlying assets. The
    assets held by the fund may be denominated in a wide variety of currencies.
    The investment advisor may use foreign exchange and related derivative
    instruments to hedge or implement currency positions."

    the Fund will be investors who are looking to maximise total return through
    a combination of both income and capital growth and are looking for a
    diversified exposure to fixed income markets that are economically tied to
    emerging market countries and are willing to accept the risks and volatility
    associated with investing in such markets and who have an investment horizon
    over the medium to long term."
  04040_Investment_Objective_Portfolio:
    'Objectives The fund aims to maximise the
    total return on your investment by primarily investing in a range of fixed
    income securities and instruments, issued by companies or governments from
    emerging market countries using prudent investment management, consistent
    with the preservation of capital and sustainable investing (by explicitly
    integrating environmental, social and governance factors into the investment
    process as further outlined herein). Investment Policy The fund’s approach
    to sustainable investing is through the promotion of environmental and
    social characteristics (while the fund does not have sustainable investment
    as its objective, it seeks to invest a portion of its assets in sustainable
    investments). The fund aims to achieve this objective by investing primarily
    in a range of fixed income securities and instruments (which are similar to
    loans that pay a fixed or variable rate of interest) issued by companies or
    governments from emerging markets around the world (which in investment
    terms are those economies that are not as developed). The fund will make
    meaningful allocations to ESG Fixed Income Securities (as described in the
    company’s prospectus) and unlabelled (i.e. securities that are issued
    without formal certification) green bonds, social bonds, sustainability
    bonds and sustainability-linked bonds. The investment advisor will choose
    securities based on a screening process which incorporates environmental,
    social and governance (ESG) factors and which includes an ethical screening
    process provided by the socially responsible advisor on a periodic basis. In
    addition, the fund will seek to reduce the carbon footprint, including
    intensity and emissions of the portfolio’s corporate holdings. The fund will
    also promote environmental and social characteristics through the use of an
    exclusion screening process. The investment advisor will seek to invest in
    companies or issuers that it believes have strong ESG practices and may
    exclude companies or issuers on the basis of the industry in which they
    participate e.g. issuers engaged principally in the oil industry or the
    production, sale of coal and coal-fired generation. However, ESG Fixed
    Income Securities from such issuers may be permitted. The fund will not
    invest in securities of any issuer determined to be engaged principally in
    the manufacture of alcoholic beverages, tobacco products or military
    weapons, the operation of gambling casinos, or the production or trade of
    pornographic materials. Finally, the fund will promote environmental and
    social characteristics through active engagement. The fund is considered to
    be actively managed in reference to the JPMorgan ESG Emerging Markets Bond
    Index Global Diversified (the "Index") by virtue of the fact that the
    Index is used for duration measurement, calculating the global exposure of
    the fund using the relative VaR methodology and for performance comparison
    purposes. Certain of the fund’s securities may be components of and may have
    similar weightings to the Index. However, the Index is not used to define
    the portfolio composition of the fund or as a performance target and the
    fund may be wholly invested in securities which are not constituents of the
    Index. The average portfolio duration of the fund varies based on the
    investment advisor’s forecast for interest rates and will normally be within
    two years (plus or minus) of the duration of the Index. Duration measures
    the sensitivity of the assets to interest rate risk. The longer the
    duration, the higher the sensitivity of the funds’ assets to changes in
    interest rates. The securities will be both “investment grade” and
    “non-investment grade” securities. Non-investment grade securities are
    considered to be more risky, but typically produce a higher level of income.
    The fund may invest in derivative instruments (such as futures, options and
    swaps) rather than directly in the underlying securities themselves. The
    derivatives return is linked to movements in the underlying assets. The
    assets held by the fund may be denominated in a wide variety of currencies.
    The investment advisor may use foreign exchange and related derivative
    instruments to hedge or implement currency positions.'

  04040_Investment_Objective_Portfolio: 'Objectives The fund seeks to achieve a
    total return which exceeds the total return performance of the Standard &
    Poor’s 500 Composite Stock Price Index (“S&P 500”) (the "Index").
    Investment Policy The fund invests primarily in a range of derivatives in
    order to gain exposure to the returns of the S&P 500. These derivatives are
    supported by a wide range of short-term fixed income securities (which are
    similar to loans that pay a fixed or variable rate of interest) issued by
    companies or the US government. The fund seeks outperformance relative to
    the S&P 500 through obtaining a higher return on the fixed income portfolio
    than the transaction costs incurred in implementing the S&P 500 derivatives
    strategy. The fund may also invest directly into equity securities and
    securities that are convertible into equity securities. The fixed income
    component of the fund primarily invests in “investment grade” securities, as
    determined by international ratings agencies. Whilst potentially producing a
    lower level of income than “non-investment grade” securities, are also
    considered to be of lower risk. It may also invest up to 10% in
    “non-investment grade” securities. These are generally considered to be
    riskier investments but may pay a higher income. The fund is considered to
    be actively managed in reference to the Index by virtue of the fact that the
    Index is used for calculating the global exposure of the fund using the
    relative VaR methodology and by virtue of the fact that it seeks to
    outperform the Index. Certain of the fund’s securities may be components of
    and may have similar weightings to the Index. However, the Investment
    Advisor will use its discretion to invest in securities not included in the
    Index in order to take advantage of investment opportunities. The investment
    strategy does not restrict the extent to which the fund’s holdings may
    deviate from the Index. The fund will invest in derivative instruments (such
    as futures, options and swaps) in addition to or instead of directly in
    these securities in order to replicate the performance and exceed the total
    returns of the S&P 500. The derivative return is linked to movements in the
    underlying asset.'

    the Fund will be investors looking for a diversified multi-asset fund and
    those investors seeking an attractive total return over the medium to long
    term and who are willing to accept the risk and volatility of a portfolio
    investing predominantly in and allocating dynamically across global equity
    and fixed income markets."
  04040_Investment_Objective_Portfolio: "Objectives The investment objective of
    the fund is to invest at least 85% of its assets in the Dynamic Multi-Asset
    Fund (the “Master Fund”), a sub-fund of PIMCO Funds: Global Investors Series
    plc. The Master Fund aims to maximise the total return on investment, using
    prudent investment management principles. Investment Policy The Master Fund
    aims to achieve its objective by taking exposure to a wide range of assets
    from around the world. The Master Fund has a flexible approach to asset
    allocation which is driven by the Master Fund’s investment advisor’s
    consideration of various quantitative and qualitative data relating to
    global economies, industrial sectors and asset classes. The fund may invest
    up to 15% of net assets in ancillary liquid assets and/or financial
    derivative instruments (such as futures, options and swaps) for hedging
    purposes. Ancillary liquid assets include commercial paper, certificates of
    deposit, asset backed securities and money market instruments such as
    treasury bills. As a result of the direct investment which may be made by
    the fund and the use of financial derivative instruments for hedging
    purposes, the performance of the fund and the Master Fund may not be
    identical. The Master Fund will invest in company shares, fixed income
    securities (which are similar to loans that pay a fixed or variable rate of
    interest) issued by companies or governments and cash. The Master Fund will
    typically invest up to 60% of its net assets in company shares or similar
    securities. Fixed income securities may be both “investment grade” and
    “non-investment grade”. Non-investment grade securities are considered to be
    more risky, but typically produce a higher level of income. The fund intends
    to measure its performance against the ICE BofA ESTR Overnight Rate Index
    (the “Benchmark”). The fund is considered to be actively managed in
    reference to the Benchmark by virtue of the fact that it uses the Benchmark
    for performance comparison purposes. However the Benchmark is not used to
    define the portfolio composition of the fund or as a performance target. The
    Master Fund may invest substantially in emerging markets, which in
    investment terms are those economies that are not as developed. The Master
    Fund may invest up to 15% of its total assets in commodity related
    instruments. The Master Fund may gain exposure to property through property
    related instruments including listed company shares, real estate investment
    trusts (REITs) or derivatives based on property related indices. The Master
    Fund will promote environmental characteristics through active engagement
    with companies and issuers and exclusion screening as further detailed in
    the Supplement to the Prospectus of the Master Fund entitled “Promotion of
    Environmental Characteristics”. The Master Fund may use derivative
    instruments (such as futures, options and swaps) for hedging and/or as part
    of its investment strategy. The assets held by the Master Fund may be
    denominated in a wide variety of currencies. The investment advisor of the
    Master Fund may use foreign exchange and related derivative instruments to
    hedge or implement currency positions."

  04030_Intended_Target_Market_Retail_Investor_Portfolio: "Typical investors in
    the Fund will be investors looking for a diversified multi-asset fund and
    those investors seeking an attractive total return over the medium to long
    term and who are willing to accept the risk and volatility of a portfolio
    investing predominantly in and allocating dynamically across global equity
    and fixed income markets."
  04040_Investment_Objective_Portfolio: "Objectives The investment objective of
    the fund is to invest at least 85% of its assets in the Dynamic Multi-Asset
    Fund (the “Master Fund”), a sub-fund of PIMCO Funds: Global Investors Series
    plc. The Master Fund aims to maximise the total return on investment, using
    prudent investment management principles. Investment Policy The Master Fund
    aims to achieve its objective by taking exposure to a wide range of assets
    from around the world. The Master Fund has a flexible approach to asset
    allocation which is driven by the Master Fund’s investment advisor’s
    consideration of various quantitative and qualitative data relating to
    global economies, industrial sectors and asset classes. The fund may invest
    up to 15% of net assets in ancillary liquid assets and/or financial
    derivative instruments (such as futures, options and swaps) for hedging
    purposes. Ancillary liquid assets include commercial paper, certificates of
    deposit, asset backed securities and money market instruments such as
    treasury bills. As a result of the direct investment which may be made by
    the fund and the use of financial derivative instruments for hedging
    purposes, the performance of the fund and the Master Fund may not be
    identical. The Master Fund will invest in company shares, fixed income
    securities (which are similar to loans that pay a fixed or variable rate of
    interest) issued by companies or governments and cash. The Master Fund will
    typically invest up to 60% of its net assets in company shares or similar
    securities. Fixed income securities may be both “investment grade” and
    “non-investment grade”. Non-investment grade securities are considered to be
    more risky, but typically produce a higher level of income. The fund intends
    to measure its performance against the ICE BofA ESTR Overnight Rate Index
    (the “Benchmark”). The fund is considered to be actively managed in
    reference to the Benchmark by virtue of the fact that it uses the Benchmark
    for performance comparison purposes. However the Benchmark is not used to
    define the portfolio composition of the fund or as a performance target. The
    Master Fund may invest substantially in emerging markets, which in
    investment terms are those economies that are not as developed. The Master
    Fund may invest up to 15% of its total assets in commodity related
    instruments. The Master Fund may gain exposure to property through property
    related instruments including listed company shares, real estate investment
    trusts (REITs) or derivatives based on property related indices. The Master
    Fund will promote environmental characteristics through active engagement
    with companies and issuers and exclusion screening as further detailed in
    the Supplement to the Prospectus of the Master Fund entitled “Promotion of
    Environmental Characteristics”. The Master Fund may use derivative
    instruments (such as futures, options and swaps) for hedging and/or as part
    of its investment strategy. The assets held by the Master Fund may be
    denominated in a wide variety of currencies. The investment advisor of the

    a combination of both income and capital growth and are looking for a
    diversified exposure to emerging Asia fixed income markets, including non
    investment grade securities, and are willing to accept the risks and
    volatility associated with investing in such markets and who have an
    investment horizon over the medium to long term."
  04040_Investment_Objective_Portfolio: "Objectives The fund seeks to generate
    attractive and stable income. Long-term capital appreciation is a secondary
    objective. Investment Policy The fund invests in a broad array of fixed
    income instruments (which are similar to loans and pay a fixed or variable
    rate of interest) issued by companies or governments. The fund will
    concentrate its investments in securities from issuers domiciled in Asia
    ex-Japan but may invest up to one third of its total assets in fixed income
    instruments from issuers domiciled outside Asia ex-Japan. The fund is
    considered to be actively managed in reference to the JPMorgan Asia Credit
    Index (JACI) (the “Index”) by virtue of the fact that the Index is used for
    calculating the global exposure of the fund using the relative VaR
    methodology and for performance comparison purposes. Certain of the fund’s
    securities may be components of and may have similar weightings to the
    Index. However, the Index is not used to define the portfolio composition of
    the fund or as a performance target and the fund may be wholly invested in
    securities which are not constituents of the Index. The average portfolio
    duration of the fund will normally vary between 2 and 8 years based on the
    investment advisor’s forecast for interest rates. Duration measures the
    sensitivity of the fixed income securities to interest rate risk. The longer
    the duration the higher the sensitivity to changes in interest rates. The
    fund invests in “investment grade” and “non-investment grade” securities.
    The fund may invest up to 50% of total assets in “non-investment grade”
    securities. Non-investment grade securities are considered to be more risky,
    but typically produce a higher level of income. The fund may invest in
    emerging markets, which in investment terms are those economies that are not
    as developed. Emerging markets exposure may be denominated in USD or local
    currencies. The fund may invest in derivative instruments (such as futures,
    options and swaps) rather than directly in the underlying securities
    themselves. The derivatives return is linked to movements in the underlying
    assets. The assets held by the fund may be denominated in a wide variety of
    currencies with non-USD currency exposure limited to 20% of total assets.
    The investment advisor may use foreign exchange and related derivative
    instruments to hedge or implement currency positions."

    fund invests in “investment grade” and “non-investment grade” securities.
    The fund may invest up to 50% of total assets in “non-investment grade”
    securities. Non-investment grade securities are considered to be more risky,
    but typically produce a higher level of income. The fund may invest in
    emerging markets, which in investment terms are those economies that are not
    as developed. Emerging markets exposure may be denominated in USD or local
    currencies. The fund may invest in derivative instruments (such as futures,
    options and swaps) rather than directly in the underlying securities
    themselves. The derivatives return is linked to movements in the underlying
    assets. The assets held by the fund may be denominated in a wide variety of
    currencies with non-USD currency exposure limited to 20% of total assets.
    The investment advisor may use foreign exchange and related derivative
    instruments to hedge or implement currency positions."

    the Fund will be investors who are looking to maximise total return through
    a combination of both income and capital growth and are looking for a
    diversified exposure to emerging Asia fixed income markets, including non
    investment grade securities, and are willing to accept the risks and
    volatility associated with investing in such markets and who have an
    investment horizon over the medium to long term."
  04040_Investment_Objective_Portfolio: "Objectives The fund seeks to generate
    attractive and stable income. Long-term capital appreciation is a secondary
    objective. Investment Policy The fund invests in a broad array of fixed
    income instruments (which are similar to loans and pay a fixed or variable
    rate of interest) issued by companies or governments. The fund will
    concentrate its investments in securities from issuers domiciled in Asia
    ex-Japan but may invest up to one third of its total assets in fixed income
    instruments from issuers domiciled outside Asia ex-Japan. The fund is
    considered to be actively managed in reference to the JPMorgan Asia Credit
    Index (JACI) (the “Index”) by virtue of the fact that the Index is used for
    calculating the global exposure of the fund using the relative VaR
    methodology and for performance comparison purposes. Certain of the fund’s
    securities may be components of and may have similar weightings to the
    Index. However, the Index is not used to define the portfolio composition of
    the fund or as a performance target and the fund may be wholly invested in
    securities which are not constituents of the Index. The average portfolio
    duration of the fund will normally vary between 2 and 8 years based on the
    investment advisor’s forecast for interest rates. Duration measures the
    sensitivity of the fixed income securities to interest rate risk. The longer

  04030_Intended_Target_Market_Retail_Investor_Portfolio: "Typical investors in
    the Fund will be investors who are looking to maximise total return through
    a combination of both income and capital growth and are looking for a
    diversified exposure to emerging Asia fixed income markets, including non
    investment grade securities, and are willing to accept the risks and
    volatility associated with investing in such markets and who have an
    investment horizon over the medium to long term."
  04040_Investment_Objective_Portfolio: "Objectives The fund seeks to generate
    attractive and stable income. Long-term capital appreciation is a secondary
    objective. Investment Policy The fund invests in a broad array of fixed
    income instruments (which are similar to loans and pay a fixed or variable
    rate of interest) issued by companies or governments. The fund will
    concentrate its investments in securities from issuers domiciled in Asia
    ex-Japan but may invest up to one third of its total assets in fixed income
    instruments from issuers domiciled outside Asia ex-Japan. The fund is
    considered to be actively managed in reference to the JPMorgan Asia Credit
    Index (JACI) (the “Index”) by virtue of the fact that the Index is used for
    calculating the global exposure of the fund using the relative VaR
    methodology and for performance comparison purposes. Certain of the fund’s
    securities may be components of and may have similar weightings to the
    Index. However, the Index is not used to define the portfolio composition of
    the fund or as a performance target and the fund may be wholly invested in
    securities which are not constituents of the Index. The average portfolio
    duration of the fund will normally vary between 2 and 8 years based on the
    investment advisor’s forecast for interest rates. Duration measures the
    sensitivity of the fixed income securities to interest rate risk. The longer
    the duration the higher the sensitivity to changes in interest rates. The
    fund invests in “investment grade” and “non-investment grade” securities.
    The fund may invest up to 50% of total assets in “non-investment grade”
    securities. Non-investment grade securities are considered to be more risky,
    but typically produce a higher level of income. The fund may invest in
    emerging markets, which in investment terms are those economies that are not
    as developed. Emerging markets exposure may be denominated in USD or local
    currencies. The fund may invest in derivative instruments (such as futures,
    options and swaps) rather than directly in the underlying securities
    themselves. The derivatives return is linked to movements in the underlying
    assets. The assets held by the fund may be denominated in a wide variety of
    currencies with non-USD currency exposure limited to 20% of total assets.
    The investment advisor may use foreign exchange and related derivative
    instruments to hedge or implement currency positions."

  04030_Intended_Target_Market_Retail_Investor_Portfolio: "Typical investors in
    the Fund will be investors who are looking to maximise total return through
    a combination of both income and capital growth and are looking for a
    diversified exposure to emerging Asia fixed income markets, including non
    investment grade securities, and are willing to accept the risks and
    volatility associated with investing in such markets and who have an
    investment horizon over the medium to long term."
  04040_Investment_Objective_Portfolio: "Objectives The fund seeks to generate
    attractive and stable income. Long-term capital appreciation is a secondary
    objective. Investment Policy The fund invests in a broad array of fixed
    income instruments (which are similar to loans and pay a fixed or variable
    rate of interest) issued by companies or governments. The fund will
    concentrate its investments in securities from issuers domiciled in Asia
    ex-Japan but may invest up to one third of its total assets in fixed income
    instruments from issuers domiciled outside Asia ex-Japan. The fund is
    considered to be actively managed in reference to the JPMorgan Asia Credit
    Index (JACI) (the “Index”) by virtue of the fact that the Index is used for
    calculating the global exposure of the fund using the relative VaR
    methodology and for performance comparison purposes. Certain of the fund’s
    securities may be components of and may have similar weightings to the
    Index. However, the Index is not used to define the portfolio composition of
    the fund or as a performance target and the fund may be wholly invested in
    securities which are not constituents of the Index. The average portfolio
    duration of the fund will normally vary between 2 and 8 years based on the
    investment advisor’s forecast for interest rates. Duration measures the
    sensitivity of the fixed income securities to interest rate risk. The longer
    the duration the higher the sensitivity to changes in interest rates. The
    fund invests in “investment grade” and “non-investment grade” securities.
    The fund may invest up to 50% of total assets in “non-investment grade”
    securities. Non-investment grade securities are considered to be more risky,
    but typically produce a higher level of income. The fund may invest in
    emerging markets, which in investment terms are those economies that are not
    as developed. Emerging markets exposure may be denominated in USD or local
    currencies. The fund may invest in derivative instruments (such as futures,
    options and swaps) rather than directly in the underlying securities
    themselves. The derivatives return is linked to movements in the underlying
    assets. The assets held by the fund may be denominated in a wide variety of
    currencies with non-USD currency exposure limited to 20% of total assets.
    The investment advisor may use foreign exchange and related derivative
    instruments to hedge or implement currency positions."

    a combination of both income and capital growth and are looking for a

    volatility associated with investing in such markets and who have an
    investment horizon over the medium to long term."
  04040_Investment_Objective_Portfolio: "Objectives The fund seeks to generate
    attractive and stable income. Long-term capital appreciation is a secondary
    objective. Investment Policy The fund invests in a broad array of fixed
    income instruments (which are similar to loans and pay a fixed or variable
    rate of interest) issued by companies or governments. The fund will
    concentrate its investments in securities from issuers domiciled in Asia
    ex-Japan but may invest up to one third of its total assets in fixed income
    instruments from issuers domiciled outside Asia ex-Japan. The fund is
    considered to be actively managed in reference to the JPMorgan Asia Credit
    Index (JACI) (the “Index”) by virtue of the fact that the Index is used for
    calculating the global exposure of the fund using the relative VaR
    methodology and for performance comparison purposes. Certain of the fund’s
    securities may be components of and may have similar weightings to the
    Index. However, the Index is not used to define the portfolio composition of
    the fund or as a performance target and the fund may be wholly invested in
    securities which are not constituents of the Index. The average portfolio
    duration of the fund will normally vary between 2 and 8 years based on the
    investment advisor’s forecast for interest rates. Duration measures the
    sensitivity of the fixed income securities to interest rate risk. The longer
    the duration the higher the sensitivity to changes in interest rates. The
    fund invests in “investment grade” and “non-investment grade” securities.
    The fund may invest up to 50% of total assets in “non-investment grade”
    securities. Non-investment grade securities are considered to be more risky,
    but typically produce a higher level of income. The fund may invest in
    emerging markets, which in investment terms are those economies that are not
    as developed. Emerging markets exposure may be denominated in USD or local
    currencies. The fund may invest in derivative instruments (such as futures,
    options and swaps) rather than directly in the underlying securities
    themselves. The derivatives return is linked to movements in the underlying
    assets. The assets held by the fund may be denominated in a wide variety of
    currencies with non-USD currency exposure limited to 20% of total assets.
    The investment advisor may use foreign exchange and related derivative
    instruments to hedge or implement currency positions."

  04030_Intended_Target_Market_Retail_Investor_Portfolio: "Typical investors in
    the Fund will be investors who are looking to maximise total return through
    a combination of both income and capital growth and are looking for a
    diversified exposure to emerging Asia fixed income markets, including non
    investment grade securities, and are willing to accept the risks and
    volatility associated with investing in such markets and who have an
    investment horizon over the medium to long term."
  04040_Investment_Objective_Portfolio: "Objectives The fund seeks to generate
    attractive and stable income. Long-term capital appreciation is a secondary
    objective. Investment Policy The fund invests in a broad array of fixed
    income instruments (which are similar to loans and pay a fixed or variable
    rate of interest) issued by companies or governments. The fund will
    concentrate its investments in securities from issuers domiciled in Asia
    ex-Japan but may invest up to one third of its total assets in fixed income
    instruments from issuers domiciled outside Asia ex-Japan. The fund is
    considered to be actively managed in reference to the JPMorgan Asia Credit
    Index (JACI) (the “Index”) by virtue of the fact that the Index is used for
    calculating the global exposure of the fund using the relative VaR
    methodology and for performance comparison purposes. Certain of the fund’s
    securities may be components of and may have similar weightings to the
    Index. However, the Index is not used to define the portfolio composition of
    the fund or as a performance target and the fund may be wholly invested in
    securities which are not constituents of the Index. The average portfolio
    duration of the fund will normally vary between 2 and 8 years based on the
    investment advisor’s forecast for interest rates. Duration measures the
    sensitivity of the fixed income securities to interest rate risk. The longer
    the duration the higher the sensitivity to changes in interest rates. The
    fund invests in “investment grade” and “non-investment grade” securities.
    The fund may invest up to 50% of total assets in “non-investment grade”
    securities. Non-investment grade securities are considered to be more risky,
    but typically produce a higher level of income. The fund may invest in
    emerging markets, which in investment terms are those economies that are not
    as developed. Emerging markets exposure may be denominated in USD or local
    currencies. The fund may invest in derivative instruments (such as futures,
    options and swaps) rather than directly in the underlying securities
    themselves. The derivatives return is linked to movements in the underlying
    assets. The assets held by the fund may be denominated in a wide variety of
    currencies with non-USD currency exposure limited to 20% of total assets.
    The investment advisor may use foreign exchange and related derivative
    instruments to hedge or implement currency positions."
